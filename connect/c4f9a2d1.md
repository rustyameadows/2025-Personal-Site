# Operations Specialist

## Rusty Meadows is an operations specialist who works fluently across hardware, software, and physical systems.

Rusty is most effective in early-stage environments where priorities shift quickly and ownership is fluid.

Rusty translates strategy into execution, aligns technical and creative contributors, and builds practical operating rhythms that let teams ship faster with less chaos.

## Where I Tend to Move the Needle

- Shipping becomes more consistent because priorities and ownership stop drifting  
- Founders spend less time untangling coordination knots  
- Teams get clearer visibility into what’s active, blocked, or at risk  
- Work transitions between people and vendors with less loss and rework  
- Operating structure grows alongside the team instead of being rebuilt repeatedly  

### Ways to Work Together

- Fractional operating leadership  
- Project-based system builds  
- Embedded execution sprints
